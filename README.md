# DAA Problems
This repository contains solutions for several problems given in the DAA subject.

## Problem 1

This problem seeks to minimize the total cost of a set of objects that increases as time progresses, where the increase of the latter is not constant, but depends on the distances. between those objects. First, a brute force approach is tested to analyze the characteristics of the problem, obtaining all the possible solutions and returning from these the one with the lowest cost, having a complexity of O(n ∗ n!). After realizing several interesting properties of the problem, an optimization of the previous algorithm is developed, generating fewer permutations to analyze. Then, a recursive solution is carried out in which all possible cases are explored, taking 2 possible decisions with a cost of O(n ∗ 2n). Finally, in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithms, several greedy solutions are developed that seek to minimize the cost of the objects. After several attempts, it is concluded that this approach may not be the right one for resolution.

## Problem 2

This problem consists of, given a list of l numbers, determining the number of ways to equalize all the numbers to a value h by adding only 1 to intervals of numbers, with the restriction that the same interval cannot be selected twice. After proving several properties that these lists must meet in order to obtain a valid result, a brute force algorithm is developed that consists of generating all the possible intervals that make up a given set and then those to which transformations will be applied will be selected, subsequently checking if they are solutions with a cost of at most $O(n^2 ∗ 2n^2)$. Several dynamic ways of solving the problem were then tried, the final dynamic turned out to be too costly to consider. Finally, an algorithm is developed that, despite being unsuccessful, it is believed that a similar approach could solve the problem.
